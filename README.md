# Companion Repository for the course "Appium Fundamentals"
This repo contains the code samples I used in my Pluralsight course "Appium Fundamentals"
The master branch contains the starting point of the course.

Each module addresses another technique to create more maintainable test code.
This repo contains multiple branches that show the result after one pass of refactoring and applying one of the patterns or practices discussed in the course.

There are the following branches:
* Main -> All code for the demos
* dry -> Result after applying the Don't Repeat Yourself Principle
* srp -> Result after applying the Single Responsibility Principle and Page Objects

If you have questions regarding the course, then please get in touch with me on Twitter: @marcelv
